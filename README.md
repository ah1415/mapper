# mapper
Geographical Information System C++ Application

This application is a C++ application developed by my two teammates and I that implements a GIS application using OSM data of cities.
This program produces a GUI which can map specified cities from data and interact with the user. This program is able to search for specified locations and determine the shortest path between two locations and generate instructions for the user.

Note that this program will not run from the Github files as it requires the OSM data files and dependencies that are not uploaded.

Code implemented by team can be found in main/src/ and libstreetmap/src/
